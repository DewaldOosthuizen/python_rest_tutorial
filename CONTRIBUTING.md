## 1. Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and collaborative. Contributions that are
disrespectful, dismissive, or harmful will not be accepted.

---

## 2. Getting Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Follow the [Development Setup](#5-development-setup) section below.

---

## 3. Picking Up an Issue

**Before you write a single line of code:**

1. Browse the [GitHub Issues](../../issues) tab and find an issue you want to work on.
2. **Assign the issue to yourself** before starting any work.
   Go to the issue page → Assignees (right sidebar) → assign yourself.
   This signals to all other contributors that the issue is claimed.
3. Leave a comment on the issue stating you are picking it up and your
   intended approach — especially for larger changes.
4. Only then create your branch and begin work.

> Why this matters: two contributors working on the same issue in parallel
> wastes effort and creates painful merge conflicts. A self-assignment takes
> five seconds and saves hours.

If you were assigned an issue but can no longer work on it, unassign yourself
and leave a comment so someone else can pick it up.

## 4. Branch Naming

| Prefix     | Pattern                         | When to use                                |
|------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `feature/` | `feature/<issue-id>-<topic>`    | New tutorial section or API feature        |
| `fix/`     | `fix/<issue-id>-<topic>`        | Bug fix                                    |
| `chore/`   | `chore/<topic>`                 | Tooling, deps, CI, config updates          |
| `docs/`    | `docs/<topic>`                  | Documentation only                         |

Examples:
- `feature/42-add-authentication-tutorial`
- `fix/17-fix-mongodb-connection-handling`
- `docs/update-contributing-guide`

Always branch from `master`.

---

## 5. Development Setup

Requires **Python 3.11+** and **Docker** (for MongoDB).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/python_rest_tutorial.git
cd python_rest_tutorial
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r web/requirements.txt
```

Copy the environment variable template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Start all services (app + MongoDB):

```bash
docker compose up
```

---

## 6. Running Checks Locally

Run these commands before pushing. CI runs the same checks and a failing PR
will not be reviewed.

Lint and format check:

```bash
bash scripts/lint.sh
```

Tests:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
pytest web/tests/ -v
```

All commands must exit with code `0` before opening a PR.

---

## 7. Commit Message Style

- Use the **imperative mood** in the subject line: "Add", "Fix", "Remove".
- Limit the subject line to **72 characters**.
- Leave one blank line between the subject and body when a body is needed.
- Reference the related issue in the footer with `Closes #<n>`.

Example:

```
Add JWT authentication tutorial section

Closes #42
```

---

## 8. Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all local checks pass (see [Section 6](#6-running-checks-locally)).
2. Open the PR against `master`.
3. Use a scoped, descriptive title: `fix: resolve #17 - MongoDB connection error on cold start`.
4. In the PR body:
   - Link the issue: `Closes #<n>`
   - Describe the user-visible change.
   - Include terminal output for API or behaviour changes.
5. Request a review. Do not merge your own PR without a review.
6. Address review feedback with follow-up commits — do not force-push a reviewed branch unless asked.

---

## 9. Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8. Use `ruff` for linting and formatting (configured in `pyproject.toml`).
- Keep functions small and explicit with clear docstrings.
- Use module-level loggers: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
- Do not add `logging.basicConfig(...)` inside library modules under `web/`.
- Keep tutorial code readable and well-commented — this is an educational resource.
- Add or update tests in `tests/` or `web/tests/` whenever behaviour changes.
